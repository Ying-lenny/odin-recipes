        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        I love the tangy tenderization that the buttermilk provides. After the buttermilk soak, 
        dredge the chicken pieces in seasoned flour, and fry them in hot oil until crisp and cooked.

        Steps

    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <br><li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <br><li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>

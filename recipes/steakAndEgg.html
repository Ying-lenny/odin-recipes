        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        I love the tangy tenderization that the buttermilk provides. After the buttermilk soak, 
        dredge the chicken pieces in seasoned flour, and fry them in hot oil until crisp and cooked.

        Ingredients
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 (6 ounce) top sirloin steak </li>
        <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 4 teaspoons fine dry bread crumbs </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place steak between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound to a ¼-inch thickness. Season one side generously with salt and pepper, 
            then sprinkle ½ of the bread crumbs over top. Place the plastic wrap back over the steak and pound a few times with the meat mallet. 
            Repeat to season the other side with salt, pepper, and remaining bread crumbs.</li>

        <br><li>Set a pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons melted clarified butter and wait until it starts to smoke. 
            Quickly and carefully add steak to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Flip steak and reduce heat to medium-high; 
            cook until you see a little bit of pink juice pool on top of the steak, about 1 more minute. Flip again, turn off the heat, 
            and transfer steak to a warm plate.</li>

        <br><li>Let the pan cool for 30 to 60 seconds, then add 1 teaspoon melted clarified butter. Turn heat to medium and add egg. 
            Break the egg white so it's all the same thickness and the yolk is in the center. 
            Add a pinch of salt and cook until egg white is cooked through with brown and crispy edges. Place the egg on top of the steak.</li>
    </ol>
